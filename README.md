# Hack-a-thing-2
* I attemped to build a first-person shooter game using the Unity Interactive tutorials, I also followed the numerous tutorials unity provides to add levels, different weaponds, use audio tools, and customize scenes. Finally I wanted to be set up my Oculus Quest to my computer and have it run my unity first person shooter game.

What you learned
*The two completely new frameworks I was working with were Unity and the Occulus, In unity I learned just how complex of a system it is and the numerous possibilites to create and modify experiences. In this project I was working on a game but I could see what features I could use to create different expereinces. I also started to understand the object oriented nature of unity, at first the unity editor it is overwhelming and there seems to be too much going on to understand how to best utilize the work space. The tutorials helped me to see how the game objects in the unity editor were working similarly to objects that we learn about in object oriented programming, althouhgt i didn't get far intro programming my own object I know how they are structured and written in C which I have some experience in. 
Setting up my Oculus was a much more tedious experience than expected, and connecting it to my unity app was even more finnicky and technical, I watched tutorials on occulus to mac set up and created and occulus developper account to create an app, I then would use that app id in the unity environment to connect the two. There were issues at first with my computer even reading the occulus device when it was plugged in but I was able to get it connected and get my game set up, but the game was having issues loading and rendering in the occulus so I couldn't see it through my headset and could only play on my laptop environment
* The two images below show a screenshot of the first person shooter game from the tutorial and the second is the oculus showing up on my computer

How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?
Our major goals for our project is to get 360 video to stream to an oculus VR set. Having never put on an Oculus headset until a few days ago it was super useful to figure out what the oculus experience currently is and how I as a developper can modify or add to that experience
What didnâ€™t work
I was able to finish the experience of getting my game to the VR headset but in the process I was able to see what steps needs to be taken to even get the two systems working, now that I am much better at getting unity and the occulus working separtely I will be able to focus on getting the two to work together which is what I'm hoping to do with my project
